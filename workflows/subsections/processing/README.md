# Processing Subsection

## Purpose
Contains the core business logic and data transformation operations of the workflow.

## Responsibilities
- Execute primary business logic
- Transform data according to requirements
- Integrate with external APIs and services
- Apply business rules and calculations
- Handle conditional logic and routing
- Manage data enrichment and aggregation

## Input Interface
Expects standardized data from input subsection:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "original": "[original input data]",
    "processed": "[validated input data]",
    "metadata": {
      "timestamp": "ISO8601 datetime",
      "source": "data source identifier",
      "validation_status": "valid",
      "record_count": "number of records"
    }
  },
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Processing Flow
1. **Input Validation**: Verify data from input subsection
2. **Business Logic**: Apply core processing rules
3. **Data Transformation**: Convert, calculate, enrich data
4. **External Integration**: API calls, database operations
5. **Conditional Routing**: Branch based on data or conditions
6. **Quality Assurance**: Validate processing results
7. **Output Preparation**: Format for output subsection

## Output Interface
Processed data format for output subsection:
```json
{
  "results": {
    "primary": "[main processing results]",
    "secondary": "[additional outputs if any]",
    "metadata": {
      "processing_time": "execution duration",
      "operations_performed": ["list of operations"],
      "quality_score": "data quality metric",
      "records_processed": "number of records"
    }
  },
  "status": "success|warning|error",
  "warnings": ["non-fatal issues"],
  "processing_summary": {
    "start_time": "ISO8601 datetime",
    "end_time": "ISO8601 datetime",
    "operations_count": "number of operations"
  }
}
```

## Core Operations

### Data Transformation
- Field mapping and renaming
- Data type conversions
- Calculations and formulas
- Text processing and formatting
- Date/time manipulations

### External Integrations
- API calls with authentication
- Database queries and updates
- File operations
- Message queue interactions
- Third-party service calls

### Business Logic
- Validation rules application
- Conditional processing
- Data aggregation and summarization
- Complex calculations
- Rule-based routing

## Error Handling
- Processing failures: Log error, attempt recovery
- API failures: Retry with exponential backoff
- Data quality issues: Flag warnings, continue processing
- Resource exhaustion: Graceful degradation
- External service timeouts: Use cached data or default values

## Performance Considerations
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Parallel processing where possible
- Resource usage optimization
- Timeout configurations
- Memory management for large data

## Implementation Notes
- Create individual JSON file: `processing-workflow.json`
- Use appropriate n8n nodes for operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging for debugging
- Test with various data scenarios

## Common Patterns
- **Linear Processing**: Sequential data transformations
- **Conditional Processing**: Switch/IF nodes for routing
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple branches with merge
- **Loop Processing**: Iterative operations on datasets
- **API Integration**: HTTP requests with error handling
