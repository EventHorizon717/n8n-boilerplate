I want to build n8n workflows using Claude Code, leveraging Claude Code's highly effective, structured, organized approach developing software and tools.

My intention is to create an ingenious boilerplate template that I can use for all of my new n8n projects, with a structured folder and file format. This structure needs to have everything Claude Code needs to build outstanding, scalable, robust (built to last) n8n workflows rapidly, consistently, and successfully. This of the boilerplate template as a game changer that would give an n8n developer an unfair advantage.

This should be an advanced, best practices, architecture that utilizes the full power and capability of Claude Code.

I want there to be:

A Claude.MD file that is generated and explains the goal and purpose of the n8n workflow we're trying to build.

A JSON file with the workflow code

Stuff like a .claude folder and agents subfolder with recommendations on agents. For example, an agent that ensure JSON is formatted. An agent that ensures JSON files maintain continuity from start to finish.

A commands subfolder for potential routine commands.

Defining key .md files for critical elements of the workflow.  For example, the database schema, indexes, and rules. If the workflow uses an AI Agent to classify intents, make a .md file where those intents live so this information doesn't drift or get lost during building.

Testing and evaluation scenarios to validate the workflow.

Defined success outputs of nodes and workflows.

There needs to be a section that lists n8n nodes so that Claude Code know's what nodes are avialable to use.

I want a file or folder that specifies how to structure JSON files for N8N based on N8N's documentation.

I want a file or folder, for example n8n workflow examples in JSON which will serve as a reference Claude Code.

I want a ASCII workflow diagram that illustrates how the nodes of the workflow connect together.

I want the ability for Claude Code to break out larger workflows into distinct functional subsections that can be worked on separately with different agents. Perhaps each subsection has its own folder with its own JSON file, which is them pulled into on full workflow JSON file.

Recommend useful MCPs. I already have Context7 to pull n8n documentation.

Add anything I missed that would increase the usefulness of this template
