# Success Criteria

## Workflow Success Definition
Define what constitutes successful execution of this n8n workflow.

## Functional Success Criteria

### Input Processing Success
- [ ] All required input fields are present and valid
- [ ] Input data passes validation rules
- [ ] Malformed data is properly handled
- [ ] Input source is accessible and responsive

### Processing Success
- [ ] Core business logic executes without errors
- [ ] Data transformations produce expected results
- [ ] External API calls complete successfully
- [ ] Conditional logic routes data correctly
- [ ] Error handling catches and manages exceptions

### Output Success
- [ ] Output data matches expected schema
- [ ] Results are delivered to correct destinations
- [ ] Success notifications are sent
- [ ] Data is properly stored/persisted
- [ ] Audit trail is created

## Performance Success Criteria

### Execution Time
- **Target**: [Maximum acceptable execution time]
- **Measurement**: Total workflow execution duration
- **Success Threshold**: < [X] seconds for [Y]% of executions

### Throughput
- **Target**: [Records/requests processed per hour]
- **Measurement**: Volume of data processed successfully
- **Success Threshold**: > [X] records/hour sustained

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: < [X] MB peak usage
- **CPU**: < [X]% average utilization
- **Network**: < [X] MB data transfer per execution

## Reliability Success Criteria

### Success Rate
- **Target**: > 99% of executions complete successfully
- **Measurement**: (Successful executions / Total executions) Ã— 100
- **Reporting Period**: Daily/Weekly/Monthly

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Transient errors trigger appropriate retry logic
- [ ] Failed executions are logged with sufficient detail
- [ ] Critical errors generate immediate alerts
- [ ] Manual recovery procedures are documented

### Data Integrity
- [ ] No data corruption during processing
- [ ] Partial failures don't leave data in inconsistent state
- [ ] Transaction boundaries are properly managed
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid data persistence

## Business Success Criteria

### User Impact
- [ ] Users receive expected outcomes from workflow
- [ ] Response times meet user expectations
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] User feedback indicates satisfaction

### Operational Impact
- [ ] Reduces manual effort by [X] hours/week
- [ ] Improves data accuracy by [X]%
- [ ] Decreases processing time by [X]%
- [ ] Enables [business capability/process]

## Monitoring and Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Execution Success Rate**: % of successful workflow runs
2. **Average Execution Time**: Mean time from trigger to completion
3. **Error Rate**: % of executions that fail
4. **Data Quality Score**: % of outputs meeting quality criteria
5. **User Satisfaction**: Survey scores or feedback metrics

### Monitoring Implementation
- **n8n Workflow Statistics**: Built-in execution tracking
- **Custom Metrics**: Log specific business metrics
- **External Monitoring**: APM tools for detailed insights
- **Alerting**: Real-time notifications for failures

### Reporting Requirements
- **Daily Reports**: Success rate, error summary, performance metrics
- **Weekly Reports**: Trend analysis, capacity planning
- **Monthly Reports**: Business impact assessment, optimization recommendations

## Success Validation Methods

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for individual workflow components
- [ ] Integration tests for end-to-end flow
- [ ] Performance tests under load
- [ ] Regression tests after changes

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Spot-check outputs for accuracy
- [ ] User acceptance testing scenarios
- [ ] Edge case validation
- [ ] Documentation review

## Failure Scenarios and Recovery

### Expected Failure Modes
1. **External API Unavailable**
   - Detection: HTTP errors or timeouts
   - Response: Retry with exponential backoff
   - Recovery: Alert administrators, use cached data if available

2. **Invalid Input Data**
   - Detection: Validation failure
   - Response: Log error, notify data source
   - Recovery: Process valid records, quarantine invalid ones

3. **Database Connection Lost**
   - Detection: Connection errors
   - Response: Retry connection, use alternative database
   - Recovery: Resume processing when connection restored

### Recovery Procedures
- **Automatic Recovery**: Built into workflow logic
- **Manual Recovery**: Documented procedures for administrators
- **Data Recovery**: Backup and restore procedures
- **Service Recovery**: Steps to restore full functionality
