## üí≠ Workflow Vision & Use Cases

### **Describe Your Workflow Vision**
*In your own words, describe how you envision this workflow functioning. Don't worry about technical details - just explain what you want to happen.*

**Example**: "I want to automatically sync customer data from our CRM to our email marketing platform every night, but only for customers who opted in to marketing emails and haven't purchased in the last 30 days. If there are any sync errors, I want my team to get notified immediately."

**Your Vision**: 
```
[Describe your workflow vision here - be as detailed or high-level as you prefer]
```

### **Provide Real-World Use Case Examples**
*Give 2-3 specific examples of how this workflow would be used in practice. Include the input data, what processing should happen, and what the expected output should be.*

**Example Scenario 1**:
```
Input: New customer registration with email "john@example.com", opted_in: true, signup_date: "2024-01-15"
Processing: Check if customer exists, validate email format, check opt-in status
Output: Add to email marketing list with welcome series tag
```

**Your Use Case 1**:
```
Input: [What triggers this workflow and what data comes in?]
Processing: [What should happen to that data?]
Output: [What should be the end result?]
```

**Your Use Case 2**:
```
Input: [What triggers this workflow and what data comes in?]
Processing: [What should happen to that data?]
Output: [What should be the end result?]
```

**Your Use Case 3** (optional):
```
Input: [What triggers this workflow and what data comes in?]
Processing: [What should happen to that data?]
Output: [What should be the end result?]
```

### **Edge Cases and Error Scenarios**
*What could go wrong? Describe scenarios where the workflow might fail or behave unexpectedly.*

**Example**: "What if the CRM API is down? What if a customer email is invalid? What if someone tries to sync the same data twice?"

**Your Edge Cases**:
```
[Describe potential problems, error conditions, or unusual scenarios]
```

### **Success Stories**
*How will you know this workflow is working well? What would a perfect execution look like?*

**Your Success Vision**:
```
[Describe what success looks like from a business and operational perspective]
```
